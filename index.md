# CodeChem Helm Charts for Kubernetes

This repository acts like a helm chart repository for various Kubernetes applications, packaged by CodeChem.

## TL;DR

```bash
helm repo add codechem https://charts.codechem.com
helm search repo codechem
helm install example codechem/<chart>
```

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve the latest versions of the packages. You can then run `helm search repo
codechem` to see the charts.

To uninstall the chart:

```bash
helm uninstall example codechem/<chart>
```
